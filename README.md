# F1 Web Scrapper
Displays the current standing and previous driver's and constructor's championships based on the most up to date F1 results

## Description
Users interact with the GUI by inputting a given year and from a dropdown menu, select whether they want the results of the driver's or team's standing. A table is constructed displaying (in descending order of points) either the driver's name, their team and their total points scored, or the team's name and their total points scored. 

This project uses BeautifulSoup to scrap the web for he must up to date F1 results and displays it onto a GUI interface created using Tkinter. Appropriate error handling is enforced when invalid or missing year is inputted.
